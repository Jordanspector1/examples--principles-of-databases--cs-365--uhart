# XML Examples

Any file ending in `.xml` can be loaded in your browser by simply dragging the file over an existing browser window. If your browser ignores this action, then you’ll need to open the `.xml` file via your browser’s File menu.

If a `.xml` file has no associated CSS document, then the browser will indicate as such and simply show you the document tree. Some browsers, however, will show the contents of the `.xml` file.
