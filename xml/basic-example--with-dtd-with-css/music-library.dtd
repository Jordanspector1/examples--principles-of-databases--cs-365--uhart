  The root element: music-library

  The music-library container (root) element must contain one or more

  includes entities, or simple character data (CDATA).

  Note that the width and height attributes for the cover element are
  marked #FIXED, followed by the string "640" for width and "480" for
  height. This means that, if width and/or height were explicitly
  included as attributes to the cover element, the fixed values must
  appear as the attribute values. (These fixed strings are also case
  sensitive, so they must appear exactly as quoted for the XML document
  to validate.) Either or both attributes may be ommitted without
  affecting validation.
